## Goals ##
The main goals for Addama are to:
  * provide a platform for the integration of **heterogeneous data** types using a variety of data management systems (relational databases, graph databases, files systems, NOSQL solutions, etc)
  * define or provide simple standardized interfaces (**REST+JSON**) that are easily and **securely** accessed from any programming language`*`
  * enable the rapid development and deployment of **ad-hoc analysis tools** written in any programming language`*`
  * allow new **Web Applications** and **Web Services** to be rapidly developed and served within a single secure domain using **OpenID**


`*` _Any programming language_ -  software engineers, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists at the ISB use a variety of programming languages such as: _**Matlab, R, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, GO, C++**_.  Addama was designed to facilitate integration and support for these.
