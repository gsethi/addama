SECURING WITH ADDAMA
================================
To secure your web services using an Addama appspot download 'addama.properties' for your domain under:  
    https://your-appspot-id.appspot.com/html/apikeys.html
  
Place the 'addama.properties' file under:
    apache-tomcat-7.0.25/lib/services/
 
The 'addama.properties' file is optional, if you wish to deploy these services in "stand-alone" mode, just remove the 'addama.properties' file.

================================
LOCAL SERVICES
================================
The configuration files for local Addama services are located under: 
   apache-tomcat-7.0.25/lib/services/ 

The web services (war files) are located under: 
   apache-tomcat-7.0.25/webapps/

To re-deploy local services after changing a service configuration, you have these options:
   a) restart tomcat (bin/shutdown.sh bin/startup.sh)
   b) touch war file (touch webapps/*.war)

================================
WEB CONTENT
================================
Web content (HTML, JS, images) can be deployed under:
   apache-tomcat-7.0.25/webapps/ROOT/

For instance, the "Development Sandbox" application in "https://addama-systemsbiology-public.appspot.com" is deployed under:  
   apache-tomcat-7.0.25/webapps/ROOT/sandbox 
   and made available through "https://cancerregulome.systemsbiology.net/sandbox".
