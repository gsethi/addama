## How do I create a Google Account? ##
Creating a Google Account is similar to creating a Gmail account, except that you can use **any** email address you currently own.  A Gmail account IS a Google account.

To create a Google Account with your existing email address (me@example.com) go to  http://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount and follow the instructions.

## What is a Google Apps Account? ##
Google Apps accounts are administered by a domain (e.g. systemsbiology.org) that is configured to use Google applications (e.g. Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Groups, App Engine) branded and associated with users of that domain.

## What is the difference between a Google Apps Account and a Google Account? ##
The main difference is that Google Apps accounts provide access to services within a specific Google Apps domain.  These accounts are controlled by administrators of that domain, and they can turn off access to any service associated with that domain.

On the other hand, Google Accounts are controlled by the users that create them to access public Google services (Calendar, App Engine, Google Storage).

Google App Engine allows developers to configure access to an application.  Developers may choose to allow anyone to access their application, or only users that belong to a particular domain.  In addition, App Engine allows external OpenID providers to control access.  See image below:
