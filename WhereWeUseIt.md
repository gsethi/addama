## Cancer Regulome ##
The _Center for Systems Analysis of the Cancer Regulome_ is a _Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC)_ for _**The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**_.  The Center will build three computational pipelines that will carry out integrated analyses of TCGA-derived high-throughput experimental data sets. These pipelines will:
  1. identify potential mechanisms of genomic-transcriptomic regulation associated with specific cancers and clinical parameters;
  1. infer networks that explain cancer type-specific transcriptional profiles, and identify molecules that may be important control nodes in these networks as a means to prioritize drug targets for therapeutic intervention; and
  1. compare cancer-associated features across all cancer types within TCGA to gain insight into the regulatory basis for cancer progression in different cancer types.

This project uses Addama to:
  * present patient clinical and sequencing data and metadata based on file system repositories and datasources and indexing services
  * integrate analysis pipelines, ad-hoc scripts and informatics tools developed by ISB, as well as other TCGA centers
  * provide a secure data sharing environment, and facilitate collaboration between researchers at the **Institute for Systems Biology**, **MD Anderson Cancer Center**, other TCGA centers and interested parties.

## Systems Immunology ##
Systems Approach to Immunology (systemsimmunology.org) is a large collaborative research program formed to study the mechanisms by which the immune system responds to infectious disease by inciting innate inflammatory reactions and instructing adaptive immune responses.

This multidisciplinary international consortium includes researchers from the Scripps Research Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology, the Australian National University, and Stanford University.  It is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health.

This project uses Addama to integrate data and visualizations through a public web portal, and it also provides an deployment for internal users that provides services for managing analysis pipelines, tools and experiment data.
