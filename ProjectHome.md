The **[Institute for Systems Biology (ISB)](http://www.systemsbiology.org)** seeks to develop revolutionary approaches to understanding of biological complexity and the analysis of biological systems. The ISB brings together a multidisciplinary group of scholars and scientists, from biologists, mathematicians and engineers, to computer scientists and physicists, in an interactive and collaborative environment.

The **[Adaptive Data Management Service Architecture](http://www.addama.org)** has been designed to support the needs of researchers at the ISB.  Its main goals are to:
  * support ad-hoc software development within the research enterprise
  * facilitate the integration of large heterogeneous data
  * enable collaboration between individual researchers and consortiums

Addama _(a-duh-mah)_ provides a variety of REST+JSON web services for integrating web applications, visualizations, data management systems, and computational tools.  It also offers a platform for the rapid development and deployment of modern web applications using security and authentication interfaces provided by **Google App Engine**.  Addama software components are used at ISB to support many ad-hoc collaborations, and several large projects.

Addama is built upon existing Open Source Software from trusted sources (e.g. Apache Software Foundation, Spring Framework, Google Code).  Its design is based on the latest web and enterprise software principles.
